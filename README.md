# power-bi-practice

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to build a strong foundation in Power BI for data analytics, demonstrating my ability to visualize, analyze, and derive insights from datasets.

## Description:

PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage:

 - Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.
 - Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
 - Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.
 - Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

## Stages:

### Task №1:

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative! 

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant → average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

> Hi Janet,
>
> I'm back with the results of the analysis. The link to the dashboard is attached to the email.
>
> The dashboard analyses the behavior of PhoneNow customers, dividing them into four categories depending on the presence of customer service tickets and churn:
> 1. Customers who had tickets and churned.
> 2. Customers who had no tickets, but churned.
> 3. Customers who have tickets, but didn't churn.
> 4. Customers who have no tickets and didn't churn.
> 
> Each category has the demographic and account portrait of a majority of customers that represent it:
>
> 1. A young female who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a month-to-month contract with an average tenure of 32.85 months.
> 2. A young female who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a month-to-month contract with an average tenure of 8.48 months.
> 3. A young male who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a two-year contract with an average tenure of 50.59 months.
> 4. A young male who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a month-to-month contract with an average tenure of 36.9 months.
>   
> The list of portraits indicates the priority of actions. Clients in the first and second categories were at risk, so they changed service providers.
>
> So, for these two categories, it is necessary to review the quality of the most popular Internet services - Streaming movies and TV. In addition, analyze the main reasons for contacting the support service.
>
> Best regards,
>
