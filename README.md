> Hi Janet,
>
> I'm back with the results of the analysis. The link to the dashboard is attached to the email.
>
> The dashboard analyses the behavior of PhoneNow customers, dividing them into four categories depending on the presence of customer service tickets and churn:
> 1. Customers who had tickets and churned.
> 2. Customers who had no tickets, but churned.
> 3. Customers who have tickets, but didn't churn.
> 4. Customers who have no tickets and didn't churn.
> 
> Each category has the demographic and account portrait of a majority of customers that represent it:
>
> 1. A young female who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a month-to-month contract with an average tenure of 32.85 months.
> 2. A young female who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a month-to-month contract with an average tenure of 8.48 months.
> 3. A young male who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a two-year contract with an average tenure of 50.59 months.
> 4. A young male who has a partner and doesn't have dependents. Uses a month-to-month contract with an average tenure of 36.9 months.
>   
> The list of portraits indicates the priority of actions. Clients in the first and second categories were at risk, so they changed service providers.
>
> So, for these two categories, it is necessary to review the quality of the most popular Internet services - Streaming movies and TV. In addition, analyze the main reasons for contacting the support service.
>
> Best regards,
